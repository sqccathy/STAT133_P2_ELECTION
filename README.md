ABOUT THE ELECTION RESULTS IN 2008

I converted the excel file of 2008 election results into csv via a website. (http://www.zamzar.com)

I haven't figured out a more efficient way to make this change by R code. 

So before running the RMD file, please download the csv file and change the Working Directory( you can access from "Session" in Rstudio) to the path you store the csv file.

UPDATE THE 2008 RESULTS CODE

I finally installed JAVA and was able to use the package xlsx in r, so I changed the code for 2008. So if you want to run my code, make sure to install java(https://java.com/en/). However, the path setting for java can be complicated from my experience, so I still keep the importing csv file code and comment it out.

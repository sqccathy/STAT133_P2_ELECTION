I uploaded the intermediate files and changed all “flags” to FALSE. You'll need to download the rda files to make the code work.
When you make changes to your code(e.g. performing EDA), set createSource* to TRUE, then the data manipulation part can be carried out. When you're done with the modification, simply delete the old version of rda file and upload the updated one~

Also, wrote something while updating the rmd file. You can click on "History" and see a dot-dot-dot sign after my update.
I suggest that whoever changes the rmd file may leave some words in the optional extended description section, or here, to explain what s/he did, so as to make it easier for others to catch up~

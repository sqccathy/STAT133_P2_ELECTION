### STEP 1: DATA WRANGLING

## Election Results in 2004
```{r}
# Code by Menglu Cao

# Split state names and county names
names = strsplit(countyVotes2004$countyName, split = ",")

# State names
countyVotes2004$State = sapply(names, function(x) x[1])

# County names
cNames = sapply(names, function(x) x[2])
# Use regular expressions and string munipulations to clean county names
# Convert	all	county names to lower case
cNames = tolower(cNames)
# Remove blanks in county names
cNames = gsub(" ", "", cNames)
# Change & to and in county names

```

## Election Results in 2008
```{r}
# Code by Qichen Sun

## GML data that contains the latitude and longitude for each county
```{r}

# fips code is in GEO.id2 and I still need to add a few more last variables.
```

## Final Merge
At last, we can merge all of the data into one data frame.
